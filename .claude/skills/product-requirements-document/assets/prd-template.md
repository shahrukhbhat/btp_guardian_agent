# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Title:** [Product Name]  
**Date:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}  
**Owner:** [Product Owner / Author]  
**Solution Category:** [AI Agent | BTP Extension | n8n Workflow]

## Product Purpose & Value Proposition

**Elevator Pitch:**  
[Explain in 30 seconds the problem this solution solves and why it matters.]

**Business Need:**  
[Describe the unmet business need. Explain why this solution is required.]

**Expected Value:**  
[State measurable business value. Specify which KPIs will improve and by how much.]

**Product Objectives (Prioritized):**
[What are the measurable goals? How will success be measured? Rank objectives (e.g., 1. ease of use, 2. retail price under $100, 3. compatibility)]
1. [Primary objective - e.g., "Reduce customer inquiry resolution time by 60%"]
2. [Secondary objective - e.g., "Achieve 90% accuracy on intent classification"]
3. [Tertiary objective - e.g., "Handle 10,000 queries per day autonomously"]

## User Profiles & Personas [skip for fast track mode]
[Create realistic, detailed personas for key user types. Include demographics, environment, technical proficiency, goals, pain points. Focus on 2-4 primary profiles; trying to please everyone pleases no one]

### Primary Persona: [Name/Role]

[Write a realistic persona. Include age, role, daily tasks, environment, frustrations, technical comfort, and success measures. Make this person real—specific details matter more than generic descriptions.]

> **Example:** Sarah the Customer Service Agent is a 29-year-old support specialist handling 40-60 customer inquiries daily via chat and email. She spends 20 minutes per inquiry searching through documentation, past tickets, and product specs. She's frustrated by repetitive questions and wishes she had instant access to accurate answers. She's comfortable with technology but skeptical of AI after a previous chatbot implementation that gave wrong answers. She needs tools that make her more efficient, not replace her.

### Secondary Persona: [Name/Role]

[Write another realistic persona.]

### Other User Types

- [List additional stakeholders briefly: approvers, compliance officers, administrators.]

## User Goals & Tasks [skip for fast track mode]

[Identify what each persona needs to accomplish (goals), design tasks that help users accomplish their goals, features should support tasks that map to goals, eliminate any functionality that doesn't serve high-priority goals]

### For [Primary Persona Name]:

**Goals:**

- [State what this user must accomplish. Focus on outcomes, not features.]
- [Example: "Respond to customer inquiries with accurate information in under 2 minutes"]

**Key Tasks:**

- [List the essential tasks this user performs to reach their goals.]
- [Each task should directly support a stated goal.]

### For [Secondary Persona Name]:

**Goals:**

- [State this user's goals.]

**Key Tasks:**

- [List this user's essential tasks.]

## Product Principles [skip for fast track mode]

[Define 3-7 principles that drive decision-making throughout the project. Make principles specific to your product (e.g., TiVo: "It's entertainment, stupid", "Everything is smooth and gentle")]

1. **[Principle Name]**: [Explain briefly how this guides decisions.]
2. **[Principle Name]**: [Explain briefly how this guides decisions.]
3. **[Principle Name]**: [Explain briefly how this guides decisions.]

**Examples:**

- "Human-in-the-loop: AI proposes, humans approve high-risk actions"
- "Mobile-first: All core functions work on mobile devices"
- "Process harmonization: Align to SAP best practices, not legacy processes"

- [Make each outcome testable and concrete.]
- [Fewer, well-executed goals beat many mediocre ones.]

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- [State explicitly what the solution will NOT do.]
- [Prevent scope creep. Manage expectations early.]

## Requirements

[State requirements at the interaction design and use case level. Be clear about WHAT each feature is and the desired user experience. Leave maximum flexibility for the engineering team on HOW. Map requirements to objectives (requirements traceability)]

### Must-Have Requirements

[Product should NOT ship without these. Map directly to core value proposition. Rank-order ruthlessly—sequence determines implementation priority.]

**[Requirement ID]**: [Requirement Name]

- **Problem to Solve**: [State the user problem. Do NOT describe the solution.]
- **User Story**: As a [persona], I need [capability] so that [business outcome]
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]
- **Maps to Objective**: [Which product objective does this support?]
- **Priority Rank**: [1, 2, 3... Rank within this category. 1 = highest priority.]

[Repeat for each must-have requirement]

### High-Want Requirements [skip for fast track mode]

[Important but NOT ship-blockers. Include these only if they don't delay release. Rank-order within this category.]

**[Requirement ID]**: [Requirement Name]
